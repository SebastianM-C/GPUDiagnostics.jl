# GPUDiagnostics.jl

[![CI](https://github.com/SebastianM-C/GPUDiagnostics.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SebastianM-C/GPUDiagnostics.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

Vendor-neutral runtime diagnostics for [KernelAbstractions](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl)
code. Everything dispatches on the KA `Backend`; CUDA.jl and AMDGPU.jl package extensions supply the
vendor methods, and the `CPU` backend gets host fallbacks so the plumbing runs (and is tested) without a GPU.
No kernel is modified by any of it.

Not registered yet: `pkg> add https://github.com/SebastianM-C/GPUDiagnostics.jl`.

```julia
using GPUDiagnostics, CUDA          # or AMDGPU
backend = CUDABackend()

gpu_device_count(backend), gpu_name(backend), gpu_arch(backend)
gpu_sm_count(backend) * gpu_max_threads_per_sm(backend)   # resident-thread capacity
gpu_memory_info(backend), gpu_power(backend), gpu_utilization(backend)
```

## Device-event kernel timing

When launches are queued asynchronously, a host clock around a launch measures enqueue latency.
An event recorded on the launch stream fires when the GPU reaches it in stream order, so a pair
around a launch brackets exactly that kernel — two barrier packets per launch, no host stall.

```julia
timer = LaunchTimer()
lane = launch_lane(timer, backend)          # once per loop (device id)
for item in work
    e0 = launch_tick(timer, backend)
    my_kernel!(backend)(item; ndrange = n)  # asynchronous
    launch_tock!(timer, lane, backend, e0)
end
launch_times(timer)                          # Dict(device => [seconds per launch, …])
```

Pass `nothing` instead of a timer and the hooks are no-ops. The timer is safe to share across
per-device tasks (pushes are locked; events are per-stream).

## Telemetry: one sample, one child, one table

```julia
gpu_sample(backend, 1)              # NamedTuple: the base columns below (+ GPM counters on NVIDIA)

result, telem = with_gpu_sampler(backend, 1.0; devices = 1:2, tracefile = "gputrace.tsv") do
    run_the_workload()
end
telem.columns                       # [:t_rel_s, :device, base columns…, (:sm_util, :sm_occupancy, :fp64_util, …)]
telem[:compute_util]                # a column; length(telem) rows over all devices
gpu_telemetry_stats(telem)          # "<col>_mean" / "_peak" / "_busy_mean" / "_busy_median" (rows with compute_util ≥ 0.5),
                                    # "samples", "busy_samples", "power_capped_fraction" (busy rows at power_W ≥ 0.95 × power_limit_W)
throttle_reasons(telem[:throttle_reasons][end])   # e.g. [:sw_power_cap, :sw_thermal_slowdown]
```

Base columns, every source, `NaN` where the vendor or device has none:

| column | unit | AMD (amdgpu sysfs) | NVIDIA (NVML) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `power_W` | W | hwmon `power1_average` / `power1_input` | `nvmlDeviceGetPowerUsage` |
| `compute_util`, `mem_util` | fraction | `gpu_busy_percent`, `mem_busy_percent` | `nvmlDeviceGetUtilizationRates` |
| `vram_used_B` | B | `mem_info_vram_used` | `nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo` |
| `sm_clock_MHz`, `mem_clock_MHz` | MHz | hwmon `freq1_input`, `freq2_input` | `nvmlDeviceGetClockInfo` (SM, MEM) |
| `temperature_C` | °C | hwmon `temp1_input` (edge) | `nvmlDeviceGetTemperature` (GPU) |
| `hotspot_C` | °C | hwmon `temp2_input` (junction) | `NaN` (no NVML junction sensor) |
| `power_limit_W` | W | hwmon `power1_cap` | `nvmlDeviceGetEnforcedPowerLimit` |
| `throttle_reasons` | bitmask | `NaN` (the `gpu_metrics` blob is not decoded yet) | `nvmlDeviceGetCurrentClocksEventReasons` |

`throttle_reasons(x)` decodes the bitmask into NVML's names (`:gpu_idle`, `:sw_power_cap`,
`:hw_slowdown`, `:sw_thermal_slowdown`, `:hw_thermal_slowdown`, `:hw_power_brake_slowdown`, …).

`gpu_sample` is exactly what the sampler child calls per tick. The child is a Julia process
(`telemetry_child_main`, started with the parent's julia binary and load path) rather than a Julia
task: an in-process tick either wedges on the vendor runtime behind a backed-up kernel stream, or
is suspended with the sleeping task by Julia's GC/timer coupling while the host thread allocates.
The vendor extension resolves per-device *source specs* in the parent (`gpu_sampler_sources`) so the
child needs no vendor runtime: on AMD it reads the amdgpu driver's sysfs files it was handed and
starts in about a second; on NVIDIA it loads CUDA.jl for its NVML bindings only (no CUDA context,
a few seconds of startup that `telem.first_sample_s` records and the starvation watchdog discounts).
The child declares its own column header, so the parent parses whatever metric set it emits; it
appends rows as it samples (the trace survives a crash) and stops cooperatively via a stopfile, or
on its own if the parent dies. Any failure to build or start the child logs a warning and the
function runs unsampled.

**GPM counters (NVIDIA Hopper and newer).** With `counters = :auto` (default), devices that support
GPU Performance Monitoring — H100 / H200 / GH200 / B200 and, with recent drivers, consumer Blackwell
(RTX 5090 on driver 580 verified); no profiling privileges needed — add ACHIEVED SM occupancy (the
number to hold against the compile-time theoretical occupancy of `kernel_resources`), FP64 / FP32 /
FP16 / tensor / integer pipe utilization, DRAM-bandwidth utilization and PCIe / NVLink traffic, each
averaged over the interval between two consecutive ticks. `counters = :none` skips them. Note that
`fp64_util` is normalised to the SM's full-rate issue slots: a saturated FP64 FMA chain reads ≈ 0.9
on an H100 but only ≈ 1.5 % on a 1/64-rate consumer board.

## Measured peak FLOP/s

```julia
measure_peak_flops(backend)            # FP64 FLOP/s, dependent-FMA-chain kernel, best of 5
measure_peak_flops(backend, Float32)   # the FP32 rate of the same probe
```

No per-architecture table: the probe measures the attainable vector rate at the clocks the device
actually holds, and is never routed to matrix/tensor units (the wrong yardstick for scalar kernels).
The result is checked against a host reference so a mis-launched kernel cannot be credited. It runs on
the CPU backend too, one scalar chain per work-item, which under-reports the host by its SIMD width;
the vectorised host number is `LinearAlgebra.peakflops(2048; ntrials = 3)`, a different quantity.

## Capabilities

```julia
capabilities(CUDABackend())        # [:devices, :device_props, :events, :telemetry, …]
supports(backend, :native_mix)     # Bool; the CPU backend has :devices, :events, :peak_flops, :fp64, :kernel_inventory
```

A value a backend cannot answer is `missing` (HIP has no const-size attribute, SASS lists no register count,
a runtime without an occupancy calculator has no `occupancy`); `NaN` appears only inside the telemetry
matrix, where rows must stay numeric; `nothing` means "does not exist / not asked for" (a kernel with no
loop, `ir = false`). Every entry point belongs to one feature of `FEATURES`; calling one the backend does not declare throws
`BackendUnsupported`, whose message names the package to load when that is the reason. The conformance
suite (`test/conformance.jl`) checks a backend against its declarations and runs on the CPU backend in
the regular tests.

### Porting a backend

An extension declares its features with `GPUDiagnostics.supports(::MyBackend, ::Val{:feature}) = true`
and implements the hooks behind them. `:devices` / `:device_props` / `:telemetry` are the `gpu_*`
generics of the device API plus `gpu_sampler_sources` (and a `sampler_source(::Val{kind}, …)` for a new
source kind); `:events` is `gpu_event` / `gpu_elapsed`; `:kernel_inventory` is `backend_compiled_kernels`
(with `backend_wrap_kernel` if the kernel type is shaped differently); `:resources` / `:occupancy` are
`backend_kernel_attributes` / `backend_kernel_occupancy` (+ optional `backend_kernel_isa_info`);
`:native_mix` is `backend_kernel_machine_code`; `:ir_mix` is `backend_kernel_ir_counts`, the one hook
every GPU backend should have (a GPUCompiler job over LLVM IR). The `backend_*` names are public API,
documented in their docstrings, not exported.

## Compile-time resource report

```julia
cks = compiled_kernels(backend; pattern = r"_my_driver!")   # kernels this process compiled
r = kernel_resources(backend, only(cks))                    # at the kernel's static workgroup size
r.registers, r.local_mem_bytes, r.shared_mem_bytes           # per-thread regs, spill/stack bytes, LDS/block (missing if unreported)
r.occupancy.active_blocks_per_sm, r.occupancy.fraction       # the runtime's occupancy calculator (missing without one)
r.isa                                                        # AMD: sgpr/vgpr/spill counts, compiler occupancy
r                                                            # prints as a small table
```

Both vendor packages cache every kernel instance the process compiles, so the inventory reaches
kernels that are closures inside driver functions (an AcceleratedKernels `foreachindex` body, say)
without wrapping, recompiling or modifying them; on Julia ≥ 1.12 the closure type carries the
enclosing function's name, which is what `pattern` matches. `shared_mem_bytes` is what the kernel
descriptor *reserves* — LLVM's AMDGPU backend promotes private arrays it cannot keep in registers
to LDS, sized for the kernel's maximum block size, and that reservation, not the source, is what
caps the resident blocks per CU. On NVIDIA the report also re-runs CUDA.jl's bundled `ptxas --verbose` on the
regenerated module PTX, which separates the call-ABI stack frame from true register spills and lists the device
functions assembled out of line (what `CUDABackend(always_inline = true)` removes). Nothing is launched; the ISA
dumps cost a few seconds of compiler time.

## Static instruction mix (native or cross-compiled)

```julia
m = kernel_instruction_mix(backend, only(cks))                 # this device's code
m.counts.fp64_fma, m.counts.fp64_add, m.counts.fp64_mul         # whole binary, every path once
m.hot_loop.counts, m.hot_loop_confidence                        # the per-slot loop: one pass, nested loops once
m942 = kernel_instruction_mix(backend, only(cks); target = "gfx942")   # the MI300X code, without an MI300X
m90 = kernel_instruction_mix(backend, only(cks); target = "sm_90")     # the H100 code, from any CUDA context
fp64_issue_floor(m; n_slots = n_work_items * n_iterations_per_item, peak_fp64_flops = measure_peak_flops(backend),
    kernel_time_s = median_launch_s)                            # FP64-pipe time floor and fraction
```

The disassembly (AMD ISA text from `code_native`; NVIDIA SASS from CUDA.jl's bundled `nvdisasm` on
the cubin) is counted by class — FP64 fma / add / mul / transcendental seeds / other / CDNA packed,
FP32, integer, scalar, memory loads / stores / atomics, constant loads, LDS, control, waits, nops,
other (`MIX_CLASSES`) — for the whole kernel and for every loop of its control-flow graph (natural loops
from dominators), the hot loop being the outermost loop with the most instructions. On AMD the
loop nest is checked against the LLVM assembly printer's own loop annotations (`:high` confidence
when they agree); SASS has none, so the CFG result stands alone (`:medium` with a single dominant
outer loop). `target = "gfx942"` / `"sm_90"` compiles the same kernel — same function, argument
types, `always_inline`, static workgroup size — for another architecture through GPUCompiler, so
the code a rented machine will run can be read before renting it (e.g. whether the CDNA3 compiler
emits `v_pk_fma_f64` at all — for the scalar FP64 kernels this was developed on it does not; or
that ptxas pads an sm_120 hot loop with NOPs where the sm_90 loop has none). Static counts count
code, not execution; against Nsight Compute on an RTX 5090 the hot-loop DFMA / DADD+DMUL counts of
an FP64 Newton-iteration kernel reproduced the measured per-slot warp-instruction counts exactly.
`fp64_issue_floor` divides a per-slot FP64 count × executed slots by the
measured FP64 lane-instruction rate (`measure_peak_flops` / 2 — an FMA is 2 FLOP): the time the
FP64 pipe alone needs per launch, assuming every FP64 instruction issues at the FMA rate.

The classifiers are ordered rule tables, `SASS_RULES` / `AMD_RULES :: Vector{Pair{Regex, Symbol}}`,
built on the mnemonic grammars (SASS: the leading operand-type letter `D`/`F`/`H`/`I`/`U`, the
`LD`/`ST`/`ATOM`/`RED` + `G`/`L`/`S`/`C` memory suffixes; AMD: the `v_`/`s_`/`ds_`/`global_` prefixes and
`_f64`/`_f32` suffixes) with a short exception list ahead of each generic rule; the last rule is a
catch-all whose hits are `other` but reported as `unclassified` / `unclassified_opcodes` / `coverage`
(1.0 on all four validated targets). The vectors are mutable — `pushfirst!(SASS_RULES, r"^MYOP" =>
:int)` overrides for the session. `kernel_ir_mix` (also the `ir` field of `kernel_instruction_mix`)
walks the OPTIMIZED LLVM IR of the same job with LLVM.jl, typed by opcode and operand type (with the `contract` fast-math flag counted as `fp64_contract`: Julia lowers `muladd` to a
contract-flagged `fmul`/`fadd` pair, which the AMD backend fuses only at instruction selection)
(`IR_CLASSES`: fp64 fma / add / mul / div / neg / sqrt / cmp / cvt / intrinsic, fp32, int, memory,
call, control, other) — the arithmetic before the backend: IR `fma` 0 against 132 `v_fma_f64` /
301 DFMA is the backend's FMA contraction, IR `div` 14 / `sqrt` 3 against the machine's
reciprocal seeds + FMA sequences its expansion. Whole-module totals (no IR loop attribution).

Gotchas: CUDA.jl's `code_sass` loads the module on the current device (via CUPTI), which an
`sm_90` cubin cannot do on an `sm_120` GPU — the extension compiles with `CUDACore.compile` and runs
`nvdisasm` on the image directly, so no CUPTI and no device of the target architecture are needed.
AMDGPU.jl caches the OCLC ISA-version device library under an ISA-agnostic key; the extension evicts
it around a cross-compile so gfx942 links `oclc_isa_version_942`, not the current device's.

## Cheap probes: launch overhead, host environment, warm-up

```julia
measure_launch_overhead(backend)   # LaunchOverhead: device / enqueue / round-trip µs per launch, queue depth
host_snapshot(backend)             # Julia + BLAS threads vs host cores AND the cgroup quota, memory limits,
                                   # OS kernel, driver / runtime / vendor package versions, warnings as data
first_launch_s(timer)              # the JIT-carrying first launch per device; launch_times(timer; skip_first = true)
```

The launch probe sets the floor below which launches dominate (it differs by an order of magnitude
between drivers, and between a VM and bare metal). The host snapshot is the first section of any
report: two manifests written months apart compare only if they say what they ran on, and the
"pod sees the node's cores while the cgroup grants a fraction" trap is invisible in every device
counter.

## Report layer: manifests and readable summaries

```julia
merge!(manifest["gpu"], diagnostics_dict(kernel_resources(backend, ck); prefix = "kernel_"),
                        diagnostics_dict(m; prefix = "kernel_mix_"), diagnostics_dict(m.ir; prefix = "kernel_ir_"),
                        diagnostics_dict(timer; prefix = "kernel_"), diagnostics_dict(telem; prefix = "sampler_"))
r                                   # every result type prints as a small table (show)
using DataFrames; DataFrame(telem)  # GPUTelemetry is a Tables.jl column table
```

`diagnostics_dict` gives a flat `Dict{String, Any}` of TOML-safe scalars under stable keys: keys are
additive and never renamed, a value the backend could not report is omitted rather than written as a
sentinel, and every dict carries `gpudiagnostics_schema`. The IR counts are a separate dict so the
`kernel_mix_` and `kernel_ir_` families stay apart.

## AMD hardware counters (rocprofv3)

```julia
cmd = rocprof_command(`julia --project run.jl`; counters = :sq_issue, dir = "prof", name = "cell")   # ROCPROF_COUNTER_SETS
run(cmd)
rc = rocprof_counters("prof"; name = "cell", slots = n_work_items * n_iterations_per_item)  # one user kernel ⇒ auto-selected
rocprof_derived(rc)            # per-slot instruction counts, unit-busy fractions, achieved occupancy, clock
rocprof_summary(rc)            # flat Dict: medians + spreads across dispatches + the derived metrics
diagnostics_dict(rc; prefix = "rocprof_")   # the same, prefixed and schema-tagged for a manifest
```

There is no in-process counter API on AMD, so the wrapper runs the workload under `rocprofv3 --pmc`
(one counter set per pass; `ROCPROF_COUNTER_SETS` lists the sets that fit a single pass on gfx942)
and parses the CSV it writes — pure Julia, no GPU needed for the parsing (the tests run on trimmed
real MI300X collections). The derived metrics use the same normalisation as rocprofv3's own derived
counters: `GRBM_GUI_ACTIVE` is summed over the dies, so every per-cycle rate divides by `n_xcd`
(8 on the MI300X), and the SQ counters are in quad-cycles. Pass `kernel = "…"` (substring or
`Regex`) when the run dispatched more than one user kernel.
