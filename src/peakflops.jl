# Attainable vector FP64 peak of a backend, MEASURED — the denominator of any percent-of-peak
# figure for scalar FP64 kernels. No per-architecture table: every thread runs several
# independent chains of dependent FMAs (the instruction the production kernels are made of), the
# launch is sized to fill the device, and the best of a few trials is the ceiling scalar FP64
# code can attain on that device at the clocks it actually holds. A matrix-multiply probe would
# be routed to the FP64 tensor/matrix units on datacenter parts (2× the vector rate on A100/H100/
# MI300X) — the wrong yardstick for scalar kernels — which is why the probe is an FMA chain.
#
# Latency hiding: `CHAINS` independent accumulators per thread × the resident threads per SM
# (≥ 1024 at the default launch) ≫ FP64 lanes × FMA latency (64 × ~8 on Hopper), so the vector
# pipes stay full without relying on cross-thread scheduling. The multiplier/addend derive from
# a per-thread seed so nothing folds at compile time, and the recurrence converges (|x| < 1) so
# no overflow or denormal slow paths distort the timing. The CPU backend uses BLAS `peakflops`
# instead (the SIMD gemm peak is the honest host ceiling; a per-workitem scalar chain is not).

Attainable vector FP64 peak of `backend` in FLOP/s, measured with a dependent-FMA-chain kernel
(`$(_PEAK_CHAINS)` independent chains per thread over `n_threads` threads). The chain length is
calibrated so one launch lasts about `target_seconds`, then the best of `trials` launches is
returned (best-of, like `LinearAlgebra.peakflops`, discards clock-ramp and scheduling noise).
FLOP = threads × chains × iterations × 2 (one FMA = 2 FLOP). Never routed to matrix/tensor
units: this is the ceiling for scalar FP64 code. Costs about
`(trials + 2) × target_seconds` of device time.
